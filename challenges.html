            Challenges
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg font-light w-1/2 mx-auto dark:text-white">
            &emsp; Sticking with a monocular camera, the most significant
            challenge is that of choosing the correct model. In general, a
            monocular camera with a CNN will work for low-end systems. The model
            could be upgraded if the cost is applicable to a Vision Transformer
            if the device has the computing power available. For high-end
            hardware, running a complex model and having a LiDAR sensor is the
            ideal combination. Alternatively, a high-end model could be deployed
            on the cloud and the mobile device could request from it. The main
            challenge then would be handling the latency and requiring an
            internet connection at all times. Generally speaking, there is also
            the challenge of developing the software around the model itself.
            With the example of individuals with differing visual impairments,
            the challenge would be communicating depth information without
            visuals.

        <h1>Depth Maps</h1>

                    This is an example of a depth map. The darker pixels
                    represent farther away parts of the image while the lighter
                    pixels represent closeness. In this example, the depth
                    values themselves are relative. In metric depth estimation,
                    specific distance values are assigned to each pixel. In this
                    example, the drink itself is nearby while the background,
                    indicated by the darker colors, is farther away.
                    Additionally, the cup in the background has a middling shade
                    to represent it as further from the drink but closer than
                    the background.
