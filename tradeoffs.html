            Effectiveness and Tradeoffs
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg font-light w-1/2 mx-auto dark:text-white">
            &emsp; Given the computational challenge of providing depth
            estimation on a real-time feed from a sensor, choosing a performant
            sensor and model architecture is essential. For lower-end devices, a
            CNN is well-suited due to the simplicity of its operations. Vision
            Transformers and other complex approaches may not be suitable for
            such hardware. Additionally, a simple monocular camera would be the
            most widely-available option, as many mobile devices are equipped
            with one. For devices with better hardware or ones that rely on a
            network connection, more complex models could be viable though the
            constraints of working on an simple, accessible device would
            prohibit it.

        <h2 class="p-2 text-3xl text-center dark:text-slate-200">
            Quality and Speed
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg font-light w-1/2 mx-auto dark:text-white">
            &emsp; The first tradeoff is that of quality over speed. With
            respect to models, more complex architectures and larger models can
            provide higher quality results at the cost of requiring more
            computational power. As capable mobile phones are, running a
            real-time depth estimation model is computationally expensive.
            Unlike desktop devices which may have a dedicated GPU that can
            parallelize convolutions and attention computation, mobile phones
            are far more limited and therefore model size is staunchly limited.
            Techniques such as quantization can help reduce the size and
            increase the speed of models at the cost of accuracy and
            lower-quality inferences. METER seems to be an optimal tradeoff at
            the intersection of quality with speed, as it is specifically
            designed for mobile inference.

        <h2 class="p-2 text-3xl text-center dark:text-slate-200">
            Sensor Tradeoffs
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg font-light w-1/2 mx-auto dark:text-white">
            &emsp; Performance can also be considered with respect to the
            sensor. Depending on the quality of the camera being used, a depth
            estimation model may be provided more information as opposed to a
            lower quality camera. However, such higher quality cameras may be
            more expensive for the device. If the types of sensors enable
            enhancements over standard monocular depth estimation, as is the
            case with HybridDepth, running it as opposed to METER could provide
            better performance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-2 text-3xl text-center dark:text-slate-200">Cost</h2>
        <p class="text-lg font-light w-1/2 mx-auto dark:text-white">
            &emsp; In addition to the performance itself, cost is of paramount
            importance. If the cost constraints for the mobile device are
            relaxed, the device itself can have more computational power, a
            better camera, and other features that allow it to support larger or
            more complex models. The acceptable cost would largely depend on the
            purpose of the software utilizing the depth estimation model. For
            example, for an accessibility app that notifies users of nearby
            objects they may collide into, the cost constraints are relatively
            strict as the software should be widely accessible. There may be
            other scenarios such as creating a depth map of a single scene where
            accessibility is not as essential, such as Augmented Reality.
